Subject: [PATCH 5/9] ubuntu: Remove blank-disk.img test.

Ubuntu 12.10 has ancient parted (2.3) which gives an error on a
completely blank disk, breaking the 'part-list' command (amongst
others):

  guestfish -a tests/guests/blank-disk.img run : part-list /dev/sda
  Error: /dev/sda: unrecognised disk label

Remove this disk to avoid failures in virt-alignment-scan and other
tests.
