How the libguestfs Ubuntu PPA package is done
---------------------------------------------

I got sick of git-buildpackage which IMHO is very hard to understand.

Instead this package uses a simple git branch ("ubuntu-ppa" in the
upstream libguestfs repository).  This branch contains:

 - The non-upstream patches to be applied on top of upstream libguestfs.

 - The debian/ directory (as separate patches on top).

debian/copy-patches.sh
----------------------

A small script called 'debian/copy-patches.sh' extracts the patches
into debian/patches.  You have to run this after changing any
non-upstream patches, before doing a debuild.

Note that the ubuntu-ppa git branch is not "fast-forward".  To update
it, "git reset --hard <commit>" back to the latest upstream commit,
then "git pull".

debian/make-source.sh
---------------------

You can't use 'debuild -S' from the git directory, because
that packs up the .git directory, object files etc.

Instead, there's another small script 'debian/make-source.sh' which
builds the source.

Some notable differences from the Debian packaging
--------------------------------------------------

Doesn't use update-guestfs-appliance.  Instead we package the Ubuntu
supermin appliance.
